Note that this notebook is interpreted, i.e., if you did not load the nugridse.py file in the beginning, you will not be able to executes commands of that class. So start at the beginning and go through the notebook! I will use standard python comments to explain single lines and more nicely looking comments to add helpful information to various steps."
